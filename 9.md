A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers:
a^2+b^2 = c^2

given n find a triplet such that:
a+b+c = n

ok so first of all the properties of triplets hmm.\

how many triplets are there

condition.

c = is a sum of squares

so for each square is there a triplet?

1 no
4 no
9 no
16 no
25 yes
36

lets googl
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple

so just use euqlid formula:

a=m^2-n^2 b=2mn c=m^2+n^2

so n = 2m^2+2mi

thus we have that 

n has to be divisible by 2

and if it is 

there must exist an m such that 

n/2 = m^2 + mi

thus:

n/2m = m + i

where i is smaller than m


thus there must exist some m such that

so i used #pen and paper so this stuff not really valid

im having a hard time finding the issue with my code



test cases:
234
646
100
96

45396something
5678340
-1
30720



im ditching this equation in favour of a simpler one for iterative solution finding

so here there are some interesting inequalities

https://www.dcode.fr/pythagore-triple

time limit exceeded, that is better

https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1201/1201.2145.pdf

c is always odd

a is odd b is odd but not both


so im done im using the whitepaper to generate a map of triples.


i need to find a condition that lets me eliminate some of the numbers just by the property to speed up the calculation


ughh xdxd 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulas_for_generating_Pythagorean_triples

ok so i got plato and pythagoras families the last one is fermat family triplets."





noooope still to slow

triples = {}

    for i in range(1,160):
        a = 4*i+4
        b = a*i+4*i+3
        c = b+2
        #print("a, b, c", a, b, c)
        triples[a+b+c] = a*b*c

def michael_stifel():
    for i in range(1,30):
        a = 2*i+1
        b = i+a*i
        c = b+1
        triples[a+b+c] = a*b*c

lets try a different one and precompute everything.



WOOOO the


dicksons method WOIRKS AAAAHAHA
