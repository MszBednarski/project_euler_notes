so i need to find the largest product
in a 20x20 matrix

with 4 factors

brute force time

then make it more efficient getting rid of duplicate multiplications
given you go in a loop there is need just to get:

right product
down product
diag left
diag right

well that was ezz

didnt even need to optimize
