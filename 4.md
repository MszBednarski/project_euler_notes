A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The smallest 6 digit palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers is . 101101 = 143 x 707


so we have to find one that is smaller than N

lets go search:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindromic_number

1.

find the first palindrome after N -> 
is_palindrome
call it until palindrome found

check if palindrome has 3 digit factor

ok take the simples approach just try from 100 to 999 if there is a divisor we good check if the res is also 3 digit
