what is the nth prime number? ok just get a lazy generator.

ok ill make a generator on steroids 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes

so how do i make the sieve a generator?

store the previous prime numbers and if is divisible by any of them up to the sqrt it  means 
that it is not prime!


so i made this generator it has a sieve and divs by up to sqrt(n) by previous primes and it is too slow..

hm

if i want to use the sieve from the start not iteratively, then:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_Bertrand%27s_postulate

from that we know n &lt p &lt 2n
2 3 4
3 5 6
4 7 8
5 7 10
6 11 12

but it repeatss.

so there is an nth prime bound for n >=6

n(ln(n)+lnln(n)) -> make a sieve up to this number

i made a filter sieve still too slow

def solve_2(n):
    r = list(range(2, upperBound(n)))
    for i in range(n-1):
        r = [x for x in r if x%r[0] != 0]
    return r[0]

still performance issues
BUT we can do boolean arrays


STILL TOO SLOW OMG:


godim there is like a 1000 test cases in one thing

def solve_all(arr):
    m = max(arr)
    prim = solve_4(m)
    for t in arr:
        print(prim[t-1])
