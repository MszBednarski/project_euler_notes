What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible(divisible with no remainder) by all of the numbers from  1 to N?

hmm

the first one is obv, n!

lets take 


10!
the smallest one is 2520

2*3*4*5*6*7*8*9*10 = 3628800
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2520_(number)#:~:text=The%20factors%2C%20also%20called%20divisors,%2C%20840%2C%201260%2C%202520.

wait

it is basically 

LCM aka least common multiple
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple

lcm(a,b) = a*b / gcd(a,b), but that doesnt help


The lcm will be the product of multiplying the highest power of each prime number together. The highest power of the three prime numbers 2, 3, and 7 is 23, 32, and 71, respectively.

plan:
- make lazy primes generator
- make a prime factor decomposition function
- decompose each item in the list get the highest prime powers for each item multiply them and we have a solution!
easy it worked
