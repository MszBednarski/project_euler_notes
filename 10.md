easy reause the preavious solution

there is a million test cases for the last tests

to handle this

get the max of the cases

use a previous solution that returns a sieve with array of primes up to nth prime

use the sieve to sum up to n for each test case

still too slow

to handle that lets reuse some of the sums

actually lets try to find an array of solutions iteratively

still too slow aaaa

i this solution i made iterative tail recursive with indexing by reference what is this

lets try making a loop instead

replace tuples with arrays???
that is it im fitting a function into the bound that will work for this

ok nuclear solution

introduce solution array that has the index of the targets and is sorted and cast into a set and everythign

easy works
